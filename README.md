# ThreeDigits2Six
Hello, this is my solution to answer the question raised in a video on YouTube noticed by my co-advisor Paul Marjoram (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXxU5eLtcMI&t=1295s). Basically, the YouTuber wants to know how to take three same digits to mathematically turn into six. There is one rule, that we can not write down any extra numbers. In other words, square root is okay but not for cube root since there is a three on the top. 


My answer is shown in the pdf file.
